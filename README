What
----
This package provides a way to interface directly with the
supercollider server from go programs.

Why
---
Supercollider has a well-deserved reputation for being difficult
to learn. I believe that sclang is a big reason for this.
I also believe that golang is quite easy to learn, hence
replacing sclang with golang makes a lot of sense to me.

Install
-------
First, and most importantly, you must have supercollider
installed (go to http://supercollider.github.io/download.html).
Next, you must install go (from https://golang.org/dl).
Then
$ go get github.com/briansorahan/sc

Test
----
There are a handful of synthdef files that are necessary for
the tests, so you have to

$ make test

instead of

$ go test

Usage
-----
Find godocs at http://godoc.org/github.com/briansorahan/sc.
Also, take a look at some of the example programs in the
examples/ directory.
